## Origin of 'Usted'

How did 'usted' emerge? Why do we still use it to address a person? And why can it be abbreviated as "Vd."? ü§î Let's start with the simplest part: the abbreviation of 'usted' as Vd. comes from "Vuestra merced" (Your Grace), taking the first and last letter, thus becoming Vd. But... why "vuestra"? Doesn't that come from "vosotros," meaning plural?

## Evolution of 'Vos' and 'Usted'

To understand what all this has to do with "voseo" and why the plural is used to refer to a single person, we need to go back to Late Antiquity. It turns out that in the 4th century, 'vos' was used instead of 't√∫' (you). At that time, the use of 'vos' had a social value that suggested greater respect, particularly when addressing the emperor. During the 6th and 7th centuries, the use of 'vos' expanded and became much more complex, to the point of being used to refer to a single person.

In Spain, the use of 'vos' was modified over the centuries; over time, its use varied from being employed by someone with lower social status to address someone with higher status (from inferior to superior), to being used by someone with higher social status to address someone with lower status (from superior to inferior). In other words, the use was inverted, and instead of being used from a distance, it began to be used from proximity and later was employed reciprocally among people of equal status. Therefore, we have that in the 11th-12th centuries, "voseo" was used based on social rank, while "tuteo" (use of 't√∫') was reserved for the family sphere.

With the advance of the Reconquista in the 13th-14th centuries, social groups (nobility, clergy, and common people, composed of farmers, artisans, and merchants) were consolidated, so that 'vos' gained strength extra-group, also being used from superior to inferior. At the end of the 15th century, the end of the Reconquista again modified the forms of address, 'vos' was also used for those of equal rank, which led to a wear of the term and a new term became necessary to refer to someone of higher level, thus 'vuestra merced' emerged. Then 't√∫' regained its old meaning of second person singular for trust and affection.

Finally, "voseo" ended up disappearing from peninsular and Philippine Spanish in the 19th century, leaving 'usted' as the pronoun of courtesy and respect, while 't√∫' is used for familiar treatment (both for family and close friends) or inferiority (from an employer to their employee).

## Personal Reflection

I have always felt that when someone is addressed as 'usted', it places you in an inferior position. Precisely because of the use of inferiority from employer to employee is why I first investigated how 'usted' arose. Some time ago I was working in a company and I realized that there was a certain hierarchy in the way of addressing people: employees, when addressing the owner of the company, always used 'usted', while the owner always used 't√∫' to address employees. I understand that it may be because they want to treat that person with respect, but don't employees deserve the same respect? This is the issue why I prefer not to use 'usted'; I consider that 't√∫' is a fairer, closer treatment and doesn't place anyone in a position of superiority or inferiority.

The use of language reflects and shapes our social relationships. How do you think the use of 'usted' and 't√∫' affects your daily interactions? Could it change your perception or that of others if you started using one or the other in different contexts? I invite you to reflect on these points and consider how language can influence the dynamics of respect and hierarchy in your environment.
